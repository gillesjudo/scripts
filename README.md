# Scripts 
## Description 
This is a repository I use to practice, learn and build scripts. I am currently focused on Javascript, Golang, Bash and Powershell but I did dable in Python Previously. This repository is the more practical repository compared to the leetcode repository which is largely theory. This repo is a playground for me to have fun building scripts, some bad, some good but largely to practice building complex scripts.
